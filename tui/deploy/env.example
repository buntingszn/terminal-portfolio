# terminal-portfolio environment configuration
# ============================================================================
#
# Copy this file to /opt/terminal-portfolio/env and adjust values as needed.

# The service reads these TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_* environment variables at
# startup. All variables have sensible defaults; you only need to set
# values that differ from the defaults.
#
# After changing this file, restart the service:
#
#   sudo systemctl restart terminal-portfolio.service

# SSH bind address.
# The IP address the Wish SSH server binds to.
# Use "0.0.0.0" to listen on all interfaces, or "127.0.0.1" for
# localhost-only access (recommended when fronted by ttyd/tunnel).
#
# Default: 0.0.0.0
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_SSH_HOST=127.0.0.1

# SSH port the server listens on.
# The Wish SSH server binds to <host>:<port>.
# Make sure this port is open in the firewall and not conflicting with
# the system's OpenSSH server (which typically runs on port 22).
#
# Default: 2222
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_SSH_PORT=2222

# Path to the shared data directory containing JSON content files.
# This directory must contain content/ and assets/ subdirectories:
#   data/content/meta.json    - Site metadata (name, title, one-liner)
#   data/content/about.json   - Bio, education, location, availability
#   data/content/work.json    - Project portfolio
#   data/content/cv.json      - Experience, skills, education, contact
#   data/content/links.json   - External links
#   data/assets/              - ASCII art, boot messages
#
# Default: ../data (relative to working directory)
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_DATA_DIR=/opt/terminal-portfolio/data

# Maximum number of concurrent SSH sessions.
# Limits how many users can be connected at the same time.
# Set this based on your server's resources. Each session uses
# a small amount of memory for the TUI state.
#
# Default: 100
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_MAX_SESSIONS=100

# Idle timeout for SSH sessions.
# Sessions with no input for this duration are automatically disconnected.
# Uses Go duration format: "30m" (30 minutes), "1h" (1 hour), "45s" (45 seconds).
#
# Default: 30m
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_IDLE_TIMEOUT=30m

# Enable debug logging.
# When true, the server logs at DEBUG level with verbose output.
# Useful for troubleshooting but noisy for production.
# Accepts: "true", "1" for enabled; anything else for disabled.
#
# Default: false
TERMINAL_PORTFOLIO_DEBUG=false
